# prophet-challenge

Youâ€™re a growth analyst at [MercadoLibre](http://investor.mercadolibre.com/about-us). With over 200 million users, MercadoLibre is the most popular e-commerce site in Latin America. You've been tasked with analyzing the company's financial and user data in clever ways to make the company grow. So, you want to find out if the ability to predict search traffic can translate into the ability to successfully trade the stock.

The instructions for this Challenge are divided into four steps, as follows:

* Step 1: Find unusual patterns in hourly Google search traffic

* Step 2: Mine the search traffic data for seasonality

* Step 3: Relate the search traffic to stock price patterns

* Step 4: Create a time series model with Prophet

-------

The above description is what we were tasked with doing for this challenge. We were tasked with going through the data annd analyzing it
through the usage of the many commands and lines of code used with the:
- matplotlib
- Prophet
- numpy

and

- datetime
libraries.

We were to create dataframes and plots for different sets of data, and were then asked questions that had us analyze what the plotted data
depicted. For example, at which time was there the most search traffic/trends.
